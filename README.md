# Software Engineering and Professional Pratice

As students enter this course they team up in groups of two to develop a small-scale software system from scratch using an iterative waterfall process. Over the course of the semester, they consider an incomplete specification to derive and analyse requirements, design their solution from a static and dynamic perspective using UML diagrams, construct and test their solution in Java. Included in the experience will be use of industry standard tools for software development (integrated development environments, version control, issue tracking), and key elements of modern development practice, such as code review, peer review, and pair programming.

Learning Objectives:
1. Explain the modern techniques used in the design and development of large-scale software systems
2. Apply, evaluate and reflect on these techniques in a small-scale, but realistic scenario
3. Analyse the professional and ethical implications of software engineering decisions and propose solutions
4. Comfortably read and write technical documentation.
5. Constructively engage in interaction with peers.
